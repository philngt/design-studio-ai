# Deployment and self-hosting

The live application is [studio.agentkit.best](https://studio.agentkit.best). Cloudflare and Node run the same [Hono handler](../server/index.ts). Runtime settings are owned by [.env.example](../.env.example), [wrangler.jsonc](../wrangler.jsonc), [compose.yaml](../compose.yaml), and the [Node entry point](../server/node.ts).

## Local Node

Install Node 24+, then run `npm ci`, `npm ci --prefix packages/cli`, `npm run build:cli`, `npx playwright install chromium`, and `npm run build`. Linux may require `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium`.

For the normal self-host flow, copy the environment template and edit `.env`:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
node -e "console.log(require('node:crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"
```

Put the generated stable `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, canonical `APP_URL`, and any optional bootstrap-admin/provider settings in `.env`, then run:

```sh
npm start
```

`npm start` uses Node's native `--env-file-if-exists=.env` support, so no `dotenv` package is required. Variables already present in the process environment take precedence over values from `.env`; this lets production secret managers override local defaults cleanly. Keep the encryption key stable across restarts. Never commit a real `.env` file.

You may still inject variables directly when preferred. PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:ENCRYPTION_KEY = '<your stable 32-byte base64 key>'
$env:APP_URL = 'http://localhost:8787'
$env:DATA_DIR = './data'
npm start
```

Bash:

```sh
export ENCRYPTION_KEY='<your stable 32-byte base64 key>'
export APP_URL='http://localhost:8787'
export DATA_DIR='./data'
npm start
```

`APP_URL` must be the canonical external origin, including HTTPS behind a reverse proxy. It controls OAuth audience/URLs and origin checks. Node binds to `127.0.0.1` by default; use `HOST=0.0.0.0` for a container or trusted network. Port defaults to 8787. SQLite and assets persist under `DATA_DIR`; missing SQL migrations apply transactionally at startup. Set `ALLOW_REGISTRATION=false` to close public signup, and `NODE_ENV=production` for an exposed Node server. Configure `TRUSTED_ORIGINS` only for actual trusted application origins.

For development, run `npm run dev:api` and `npm run dev` separately. Vite proxies API requests. The Node adapter permits its local development origins on port 5173 when not in production mode.

## Docker Compose

[Dockerfile](../Dockerfile) builds the app, installs Chromium/dependencies, and runs as the non-root `node` user. [compose.yaml](../compose.yaml) requires an encryption key and mounts a persistent named volume.

Provide a dedicated Compose `.env` with the stable key and canonical `APP_URL`, or export those variables:

```sh
docker compose up --build -d
docker compose logs --tail=100 studio
```

Check `/api/health`, then authenticate and create/save/reload a project. The service exposes 8787 and stores data in `studio-data` at `/data`. `docker compose down` retains the volume; adding `--volumes` destroys it. Terminate TLS at a reverse proxy. Provider keys are entered per user in Settings, not baked into the image.

## Cloudflare

The committed [manifest](../wrangler.jsonc) owns custom-domain, D1, R2, static-asset, and Browser Rendering bindings. A different operator must provision their own resources and update the manifest. Custom-domain deployment requires control of its Cloudflare zone; cloud binary exports require Browser Rendering access.

The [Cloudflare helper](../scripts/cloudflare.mjs) loads local `.env` and `screenshots.env` when present. These are deployment credential sources and must remain ignored; they are not self-host configuration templates. Inject `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` securely. Never copy token values into docs or command history.

After provisioning the configured resources:

```sh
npm run cf -- d1 migrations apply design-studio-ai --remote
npm run cf -- secret put ENCRYPTION_KEY
npm run deploy
```

Enter the stable encryption key at Wrangler's prompt. Other installations must substitute their configured database name. Keep `APP_URL` synchronized with the custom domain. Deploy builds the application and trusted renderer; it does not automatically migrate D1. Apply required migrations before the code that uses them.

Missing browser configuration returns a capability error for server PNG/PDF/PPTX/video/GLB/glTF; JSON/HTML/SVG and React source ZIP do not require a browser. Verify health, sessions, persisted revisions, authenticated MCP, immutable publication, and actual export bytes after deployment. Release observations belong in the [finalization report](https://github.com/bestagentkits/design-studio-ai/blob/1a23d4a4a4ca4c14c6c15f2ae7318004a908ce2b/plans/2026-09-07-bootstrap-design-studio-ai/reports/finalization.md).

### Automatic production deployment

The [GitHub Actions workflow](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) verifies pull requests and pushes to `main`. A successful `main` run deploys to the `production` environment: it downloads the static assets built and tested by the verification job, applies pending D1 migrations, deploys the same commit with Wrangler, and checks public health/OAuth discovery and persistent thumbnail behavior. Pull requests never deploy. Deployments are serialized, and a superseded commit is skipped before deployment starts.

Configure repository or production-environment secrets `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` for the account owning the resources in `wrangler.jsonc`. The token needs deployment access to Workers Scripts, the custom-domain zone/routes, and D1 migrations, with any binding permissions required by Wrangler. Keep its scope restricted to that account and zone. [Cloudflare's GitHub Actions guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/external-cicd/github-actions/) describes CI authentication.

The workflow preserves dashboard variables with `--keep-vars` and does not upload or replace runtime secrets. Keep the existing `ENCRYPTION_KEY` and GitHub OAuth secrets on the Worker. CI's public probes do not create accounts. The separate [thumbnail release check](../scripts/smoke-thumbnails.mjs) creates one disposable production account/project, invokes Browser Rendering for two revisions, verifies cached bytes and ownership, then checks page/project/workspace visual inspection PNGs and stale-revision rejection. It deletes the project and account in `finally`. It requires D1 cleanup permission and must not be used as a routine local test. No AI provider is invoked. These probes do not prove a complete ChatGPT login; browser OAuth behavior is covered by the isolated verification suite.

### Release verification and maintenance

The verification job uploads the built site as the `web-build` artifact, and the build writes `dist/release.json` containing the commit SHA. Deploy downloads that same artifact, so the deployed assets are exactly the ones that were verified. The Worker serves the marker as `/release.json` and reports the SHA as the `revision` field of `/api/health`; the post-deploy probe asserts that field equals the deployed commit, so the marker proves which revision is live instead of trusting the deploy step. Owners: [CI workflow](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) and [health route](../server/index.ts).

Legacy v1 publications can expose assets that the public projection no longer references. [scripts/sweep-publications.ts](../scripts/sweep-publications.ts) scans the D1 publication rows, projects each document, and prunes the `publication_assets` entries the projection drops. It is a dry run by default and reports each affected slug/revision plus the kept and pruned asset IDs and a summary; pass `--apply` to write. It reads the D1 database id from [wrangler.jsonc](../wrangler.jsonc) and requires `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` in the environment. After `--apply`, files that were already exported or downloaded keep their old bytes; the sweep only changes stored projections. Run `node --import tsx scripts/sweep-publications.ts` (add `--apply` to write) with the deployment's credentials injected.

The [nightly workflow](../.github/workflows/nightly.yml) runs the full browser suite plus additional cross-browser coverage that change-based selection skips: `unit` (typecheck, full unit suite, packaging), `build`, `browser-full` (every spec on both device projects) and `cross-browser` (the character-editor, structured-editor and editor-ergonomics specs on Firefox and WebKit). Change-based selection in [scripts/test-plan.mjs](../scripts/test-plan.mjs) is a pull-request optimisation only; `main` pushes and the nightly run both execute the full suite.

## Optional integrations

### GitHub sign-in

Create a GitHub OAuth App with callback `https://YOUR_ORIGIN/api/auth/github/callback`. Configure `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `GITHUB_CALLBACK_URL` in the application runtime; the callback must exactly match `APP_URL`'s origin and this path. Keep `ENCRYPTION_KEY` configured for encrypted short-lived PKCE verifiers. For Cloudflare, set these values with Wrangler secrets; for Node, export them before starting the server. Compose forwards the three variables from its environment.

The sign-in dialog displays **Continue with GitHub** when configured. Requests use `read:user user:email`, S256 PKCE, a browser-bound state cookie, and a one-use ten-minute database record. The application uses the stable GitHub numeric ID and a verified GitHub email for new accounts; provider access tokens are used transiently and are not saved. An email collision does not merge accounts: sign in using the existing password and choose **Settings → Your account → Connect GitHub**. Linking requires the same active browser session through the callback. Disabling registration still permits sign-in for already-linked identities.

Operator reference: [GitHub's web application OAuth flow](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps). Never put the client secret in client-side code, public configuration, or the repository.

### Design providers and Google Slides

[Providers](providers.md) require per-user BYOK keys and model access. Custom compatible origins require the operator's `PROVIDER_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` HTTPS allowlist. There is no general-purpose URL-fetch proxy.

Google browser authorization needs `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, a Google OAuth web client with the application origin authorized, and the Slides API enabled. The user grants the presentations scope; access tokens are transient. API/CLI clients may supply an independently obtained short-lived token. Native Slides export currently rejects unsupported complex nodes and private image URLs.

### Google Fonts catalog

Optional `GOOGLE_FONTS_API_KEY` is a server-only Google Developer API key for full font catalog discovery. Export it for Node or configure a Cloudflare secret of that name. For Compose, pass it explicitly in the service environment when desired. Missing configuration uses a labeled curated catalog. Browser previews require access to `fonts.googleapis.com` and `fonts.gstatic.com`; cloud exports fetch bounded font assets server-side and embed them into the isolated renderer. Font loading does not expose the catalog key to the browser.

Design-system persistence requires the additive `0007-design-systems.sql` migration. Apply outstanding migrations before serving the new routes; preserve existing project and encryption data.

### Activity retention and optional PostHog

Activity records live in the application's database and require the additive observability migration. Apply outstanding [migrations](../migrations) before serving the new code; never reset existing projects to initialize telemetry. Queries exclude records older than 30 days. The [store maintenance owner](../server/observability-store.ts) removes old rows in bounded batches during activity, so exclusion is immediate at the query boundary while physical cleanup can lag on idle or heavily backlogged installations. Backups have their own retention policy.

Set `OBSERVABILITY_ADMIN_IDS` to a comma-separated list of explicit application user IDs only when those people need the global activity view. All other reads default to owner scope. Global access requires that operator's application session or API key; OAuth access remains owner-scoped even for the same account. Treat this setting as privileged access, independent of a browser navigation link.

Optional PostHog forwarding requires both server-runtime `POSTHOG_PROJECT_KEY` and `POSTHOG_HOST`. Use the intended PostHog ingestion origin for your project/region: an HTTPS origin without credentials, path, query, or fragment. Do not infer a host or claim analytics is enabled from a key alone. Keep the key in runtime secrets, not source, browser configuration, or documentation. Inject these variables into the Node process or Cloudflare runtime, and use the owning Compose configuration for containers.

[Forwarding](../server/observability-posthog.ts) sends only allowlisted client-event fields, including pseudonymous actor/project/trace IDs where applicable. It excludes free text, document content, full URLs, and credentials; person-profile creation and IP geolocation are disabled in the payload. This is not session replay or automatic capture. The receiver controls its own retention; the local 30-day rule does not delete copies held by PostHog.

Use the Activity coverage indicators to verify configured state, delivery failures, and last successful delivery. Configuration is not proof of receipt in PostHog; inspect the intended project after an authorized event. Forwarding failures do not change the product operation's result. Delivery/drop counters describe the current runtime instance and reset on restart, so they are not durable accounting. Provider token/cost fields can be unavailable; this view is operational evidence, not a complete billing ledger.

Custom provider connections require their exact HTTPS origin in `PROVIDER_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (comma-separated). Users supply the API version path in Settings. Migration `0009-custom-providers.sql` adds connection metadata without rewriting keys; preserve the existing encryption secret. Unlisted origins remain blocked when saving and generating.

## Backups and rollback

Back up relational data, binary assets, and the encryption secret together. Stop Node writes before copying SQLite/files, or use a SQLite-consistent backup procedure; copying only an active database file may miss journaled changes. Use D1 backup/export and R2 object backups for Cloudflare. Missing assets or encryption keys cannot be repaired by a database-only restore.

Roll code back to a known deployment while preserving data and checking schema compatibility. Migrations are not automatically reversed. Rotate exposed API/provider tokens independently of the storage encryption key. Stop development/test processes started for verification when their work finishes.

## Dependency security

The initial audit reported five high-severity findings through upstream browser-download and PowerPoint dependencies, including `extract-zip` under `@cloudflare/puppeteer` and `image-size`. No compatible complete fix was available in that dependency tree. Run `npm audit` against the current lockfile and monitor upstream updates; the tree must not be described as audit-clean.

The affected browser-downloading code is not used by the Cloudflare runtime. PowerPoint raster inputs are application-generated PNGs; uploaded media passes type/signature validation, and cloud rendering blocks external fetches. These boundaries reduce exposure without erasing the upstream findings. Successful tests and deployment do not establish a clean dependency audit.

For additional browser checks, install Firefox/WebKit with `npx playwright install firefox webkit`, then run `STUDIO_CROSS_BROWSER=1 npm run test:e2e -- tests/editor-ergonomics.spec.ts tests/observability-ui.spec.ts --project=firefox` (repeat with `--project=webkit`). Each invocation uses an isolated database; the default release suite covers Chromium desktop/mobile.

See [durable operation jobs](operation-jobs.md) for save/export recovery, result retention and Cloudflare queue provisioning.

## Community rollout

Apply additive Community and admin-claim migrations before deploying. Set `COMMUNITY_ENABLED=true` only when enabling Community on this deployment. Node/Compose defaults remain off. Configure `COMMUNITY_ADMIN_IDS` for explicit existing account IDs using private environment configuration or Wrangler secrets. Optional `COMMUNITY_ADMIN_EMAILS` pregrants are claimed only from verified email identities returned directly during GitHub sign-in/link; password registration alone cannot claim them. Removing an email from configuration revokes its claim-based grant. Explicit ID grants are independent and must also be removed when revoking that account. OAuth cannot moderate. These settings never grant observability administration.

Community uses the existing operation queue with tagged messages and the existing R2 bucket. Keep queue bindings and renderer assets available while jobs drain. Disabling Community stops normal admission/discovery; owned job status and administrative cleanup remain available. Roll back code while retaining the additive schema and encryption key; never reset D1 to remove a failed release. See [Community](community.md).

For an authorized production release check, inject the deployment's Cloudflare credentials and run `node --import tsx scripts/smoke-community.mjs`. This creates isolated temporary accounts, publishes a real design, inspects downloads, imports/remixes, verifies revocation and cleans its own records. It requires the configured production origin and database to match. Optional `COMMUNITY_SMOKE_LARGE_PACKAGE` points to a valid archive for an additional real import/memory-boundary check. Do not run it as a routine local test.
